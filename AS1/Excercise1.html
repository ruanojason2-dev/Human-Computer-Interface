  <h1>Excercise 1: Noticing the Design of Everyday Things</h1>
  <h5>Task: The purpose of this excersie is to identify 3 usability problems on the things or objects that we use on a daily basis
  <br>and propose a resolution to those problems.</h5>

  <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td><img src="../images/Object1.JPG" alt="Object 1" width="200"></td>
            <td>
              <h4>Object: Door</h4>
              <p>This door is a door that I use with frequency because it is at my house. This door was either poorly designed or it's just bad work.<br>
                Whichever the case, one can infer that it's poorly designed for 2 main reasons. Here's why:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>It has a missing handle. This makes it difficult for the user to lock the door from the inside</li>
                <li>
                  The less obvious one is that the door doesn't quite close naturally. One needs to push the door inward (assuming your locking it from outside<br>
                  and due to the missing handle (inside) and this force that needs to be made to lock the door, makes it virtually impossible for the door to lock<br>
                  from the inside.
                </li>
              </ul>

        <tr>
            <td><img src="../images/Object1.JPG" alt="Object 3" width="200"></td>
            <td>Relevant Data for Object 3</td>
