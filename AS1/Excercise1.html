              <h2>ðŸ”‘ Object: Door</h2>

              <p>
                This is a door that I use frequently because it is at my house.  
                This door was either poorly designed or itâ€™s just bad work.  
                Whichever the case, one can infer that it's poorly designed for 2 main reasons.  
                Hereâ€™s why:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li><b>Missing handle:</b> This makes it difficult for the user to lock the door from the inside.</li>
                <li><b>Doesn't close naturally:</b> One needs to push the door inward (assuming youâ€™re locking it from outside).  
                    Because of the missing handle (inside) and the force needed to push it, itâ€™s virtually impossible to lock the door properly from the inside.</li>
              </ol>
            
              <p><i>Conclusion:</i> The combination of the missing handle and poor alignment makes this door frustrating to use.</p>
